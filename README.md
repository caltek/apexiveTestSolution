# Apexive Flutter Senior Developer Assignment Solution

## Overview

Welcome to the Apexive Flutter Senior Developer Assignment Solution repository. This project presents an approach to addressing the requirements outlined in the assignment. The primary goal was to assess proficiency in Flutter development, emphasizing adherence to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, following best practices, and implementing the Bloc pattern for state management.

## Project Structure

The codebase follows a modular and well-organized structure within the `lib/` directory. The separation of components, screens, and models contributes to code readability and scalability. This approach aligns with industry best practices, creating a foundation for a maintainable codebase.

## Code Quality

The repository reflects a commitment to writing clean and efficient code. Adherence to the DRY principle is evident, minimizing code duplication and enhancing code maintainability. Best practices in Flutter development, including clear naming conventions and thoughtful widget composition, contribute to the overall code quality.

## Bloc Pattern Implementation

The Bloc pattern has been successfully integrated into the project for state management. This separation of concerns between UI components and business logic enhances the maintainability and testability of the application. The Bloc pattern aligns with our preferred approach to state management in Flutter applications.
